    <h1>Editing Soft Copy</h1>

    <p>Editing an electronic file and allowing the author to see the changes
    is called <i>redlining</i> <!--This is marked with an "i" because it is deemed a technical term-->
    (also referred to as “editing online”). Basic
    housekeeping includes removing all double spaces and converting hatches
    (a.k.a. “dumb quotes”) to quotation marks and apostrophes
    (a.k.a. “smart quotes”). The editor need not point out these changes to
    the author.</p>

    <p>Changes to the structure and wording of the text must be
    communicated to the author. A visual convention is needed for showing
    <del>deleted</del> and <ins>added</ins> <!--whenever you have text that you want to
    markup but dont have a tag for use span. we changed this to bold so that we typographically
    offset since it was originally in red. we then added a description of what it should be,
    but it is still said SEMANTICALLY. class is for classification. naming
    what they should be visually on a semantic level--> material. <s>Words to be
    removed</s> are typically struck out,
    and words <ins>added or substituted</ins> can be <span class="underlined">underlined</span>,
    <!--underlining is visual, revert to semantics--> <mark class="highlight">highlighted</mark> or
    <ins>rendered in color</ins>. A line in the margin indicates that a
    change has been recommended. <ins>[Queries to the author are
      set off with brackets.] <sup>A</sup></ins></p>

    <p>Underlining or striking out; punctuation is visually confusing, so the editor often
    strikes out an entire word, or phrase, or phrase-and types in the freshly
    punctuated passage as an addition. To hyphenate a word such as secondrate
    second-rate, strike it out and add the hyphenated form. When converting
    hyphens to en dashes (1914–18)—or changing double hyphens to em dashes—the
    editor simply keys them in. Typographic styles such as <span class="italic">italic</span>, <b>boldface</b>,
    and <span class="small-caps">small capitals</span> can also be changed directly.</p>
<!--option dash is n dash. option shift dash is m dash-->

    <p>Although redlining is wonderfully fluid and direct, it can be dangerous. “The editor must
    scrupulously remove all traces of the editing process before releasing
    the file for design and typesetting. Potential disasters include words
    that are stucktogether, a missing , or a forgotten comment to the author
    [Are you out of your mother-loving mind?].</p>

    <p><small>A. Queries to the author can also take the form of footnotes. Identify these notes with letters,
    so they are not confused with footnotes that belong to the text.</small></p>
